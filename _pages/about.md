## ðŸ”­ About Me

Hello, I'm Kun Zhan. I currently serve as the Cognitive Intelligence Lead at Li Auto, where I lead a team focused on the research and implementation of cognitive models, world models, and reinforcement learning.

My research "ambitions" are vast: autonomous driving, computer vision, 3D vision, large language models, embodied intelligence... Essentially, I'm passionate about any technology that can make vehicles "smarter"! I'm particularly fascinated by implementing cutting-edge AI technologies into robots and vehicles, turning science fiction scenarios into reality and working toward an autonomous future.

For me, technological innovation isn't just about theoretical breakthroughsâ€”it's about practical applications that can genuinely transform how people travel. I hope to contribute to the advancement of autonomous driving technology through continuous exploration.
