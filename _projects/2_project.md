# Street Gaussians: Modeling Dynamic Urban Scenes with Gaussian Splatting

Street Gaussians presents a novel approach for modeling dynamic urban scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting. This method effectively captures both static and dynamic elements in complex urban environments, providing high-quality, real-time rendering capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Scene Modeling**: Captures both static and dynamic elements in urban environments
- **Real-time Rendering**: Provides high-quality, efficient rendering capabilities
- **Complex Geometry Handling**: Addresses challenges in representing moving objects and varying lighting conditions
- **Simulation Ready**: Particularly valuable for autonomous driving simulation and training

## Technical Innovation

The approach demonstrates significant improvements in:
- Rendering quality compared to previous methods
- Computational efficiency
- Handling of complex urban scenes
- Support for dynamic elements
