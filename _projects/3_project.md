# PlanAgent: A Multi-modal Large Language Agent for Closed-loop Vehicle Motion Planning

PlanAgent introduces a multi-modal large language agent framework for closed-loop vehicle motion planning. This innovative approach leverages large language models to interpret complex driving scenarios, reason about traffic rules and safety constraints, and generate appropriate motion plans.

## Key Features

- **Multi-modal Understanding**: Integrates visual perception with natural language reasoning
- **Safety-First Planning**: Incorporates traffic rules and safety constraints
- **Interpretable Decisions**: Provides natural language explanations for planning choices
- **Adaptable Behavior**: Can handle diverse driving scenarios and requirements

## Technical Innovation

The system demonstrates several key advancements:
- Integration of large language models with motion planning
- Natural language-based safety constraint handling
- Real-time adaptation to changing scenarios
- Improved interpretability of autonomous decisions

## Applications

- **Autonomous Vehicle Planning**: More robust and interpretable motion planning
- **Safety Verification**: Natural language-based safety constraint checking
- **Human-AI Interaction**: Better communication of planning decisions
- **Research Platform**: Foundation for further research in language-guided planning

This work represents a significant step toward making autonomous vehicle planning more interpretable, safe, and adaptable to complex real-world scenarios.
