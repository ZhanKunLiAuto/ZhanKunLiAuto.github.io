I'm excited to announce that our paper "Street Gaussians: Modeling Dynamic Urban Scenes with Gaussian Splatting" has been accepted to the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2024!

This work presents a novel approach for modeling dynamic urban scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting, effectively capturing both static and dynamic elements in complex urban environments. Our method provides high-quality, real-time rendering capabilities while addressing challenges in representing moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and complex geometries.

The paper demonstrates significant improvements in rendering quality and computational efficiency compared to previous methods, making it particularly valuable for autonomous driving simulation and training.

We believe this work represents an important step forward in creating more realistic and efficient 3D representations of urban environments for autonomous driving applications.

Stay tuned for our presentation at ECCV 2024!
